ISLC Website — Mock Design Project
A conceptual front-end design for the future Islamic Society of Lake Charles website

Overview
This project is a mock website design created to visualize how an official ISLC (Islamic Society of Lake Charles) website could function and appear. It is a front-end only UI prototype intended to show layout, structure, navigation flow, and visual direction for a potential full website.

This project was developed independently by Hafsah Khan.

Features
• Basic navigation layout
• Homepage concept with organized sections
• Placeholder pages for future expansion
• Built with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, optional JS)

Running the Project Locally
No special setup required. Simply download and open.

Steps:

Download and extract the ZIP file.

Locate index.html.

Open index.html in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to serve as a visual template for what a future ISLC website could include — such as event information, announcements, community programs, donation options, and general masjid resources. This is not a completed official website, but a visual concept to guide future development.
